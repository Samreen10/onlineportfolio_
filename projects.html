            <h2>Pac Man</h2>
            <img src="image.png">
            <p>This project utilized the block code of when something happens.</p>
            <p>For example, when the down button clicked, the pacman should go down.</p>
            <p>Similarly, the when block was tweaked to adapt to different levels of the game. </p>
            <p>This app tested various block coding skills such as the ability to implement the call to block and use x and y coordinates to randomly place items.</p>
            <p>In this app, instead of keeping the simple pac man game, me and my partners expanded on the simple code.</p>
            <p>We added secret levels to enhance the game and keep the user interested.</p>
            <p>This app was a spin on the pac man game made with simple when block code, made to entice any player.</p>

            <h2>Sandwich Shop</h2>
            <img src="image2.png">
            <p>This was an application made with python. The main function was to take an order that included sandwiches, fries, drinks, and ketchup packets.</p>
            <p>The app was achieved by utilizing many input functions, is digit functions, and many while loops. This created foolproof code that helped avoid errors.</p>
            <p>This app was interesting since required advanced python skills and included different parts of code that joined together to create an interactive application.</p>
